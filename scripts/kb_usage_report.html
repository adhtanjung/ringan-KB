1. Listen to them: Offer a listening ear without judgment. Let them express their feelings and thoughts without feeling rushed or dismissed.

2. Encourage professional help: Suggest that they seek help from a mental health professional such as a therapist or counselor. Offer to help them find resources if needed.

3. Be patient and understanding: Understand that depression can affect a person's mood, energy levels, and motivation. Be patient with them and offer your support consistently.

4. Offer practical help: Help them with daily tasks or responsibilities if they are struggling to manage them due to depression. This could include cooking a meal, running errands, or helping with household chores.

5. Stay connected: Check in on them regularly, even if they may not always feel like talking. Let them know you are there for them and that they are not alone.

Remember, everyone's experience with depression is unique, so it's essential to approach each situation with empathy and understanding. If you're unsure how to help, encouraging them to seek professional help is always a good step.</div>
